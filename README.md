# Rock Paper Scissors Learning Project

A progressive Python game designed to teach programming concepts to a 12-year-old through hands-on development.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Learn Python programming fundamentals through game development
- Build incrementally from simple CLI to advanced web applications
- Explore AI concepts through opponent behavior
- Have fun while coding!

## 🎮 Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation** - Starting with basic CLI gameplay

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Set up Python environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Run the game (when implemented)
python src/main.py
```

## 📚 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Easy & Fun)
- ✅ Basic CLI Game - Human vs Computer
- ⏳ Multi-Round Tournament - Best of 3, 5, etc.
- ⏳ Game Statistics - Track wins/losses

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Intermediate)
- ⏳ Pattern Recognition AI
- ⏳ Multiple AI Personalities

### Phase 3: Enhanced Experience (Advanced)
- ⏳ Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
- ⏳ Web Interface
- ⏳ Real-time Multiplayer

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- **Phase 1**: Variables, input/output, loops, conditionals, file I/O
- **Phase 2**: Classes, objects, algorithms, data structures
- **Phase 3**: Web development, APIs, concurrent programming

## 📋 Development

See `docs/BACKLOG.md` for detailed feature backlog ready for Linear.app project management.

## 🎓 For Educators

This project is designed to be:
- **Progressive**: Each feature builds on previous knowledge
- **Practical**: Learn by building something fun
- **Flexible**: Can be adapted for different skill levels
