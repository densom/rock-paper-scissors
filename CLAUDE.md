# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Rock Paper Scissors learning project - a progressive Python game to teach programming concepts to a 12-year-old. Starts with basic CLI gameplay and evolves into web applications with AI opponents.

## Development Setup

### Python Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Add dependencies to the project
uv add <package-name>
# Add development dependencies
uv add --dev <package-name>
# Install all dependencies from pyproject.toml
uv sync

# Run the game
uv run python src/main.py

# Run tests (when added)
uv run python -m pytest tests/

# Code formatting (when added)
uv run black src/
uv run flake8 src/
```

```

## Architecture

- **Phase 1**: Simple procedural Python with basic game logic
- **Phase 2**: Object-oriented design with AI classes
- **Phase 3**: Web framework integration (Flask/FastAPI)
- **Phase 4**: Real-time features with WebSockets

## Development Guidelines

- Keep code simple and well-commented for learning purposes
- Each phase should build incrementally on the previous
- Focus on teaching one concept at a time
- Include plenty of print statements for debugging and learning

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branch
- Ensure branch names or commit messages include the Linear ID so Linear auto-links commits/PRs.
- Branch names should be in the format `<issue-id>-title`
  - e.g., `den-9-rps-001-basic-cli-game`

### Git Commit

- When creating commits, use descriptive messages that explain the changes
- Do NOT include the ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) footer
- Do NOT include Co-Authored-By: Claude attribution
- Keep commit messages concise but informative
- Always reference the Linear issue ID in commits using the format: `<issue-id>: <descriptive message>`.
- Use Linear magic words with issue IDs to facilitate triggering automatic workflow updates

#### Linear Magic Words

**Closing Magic Words** (will close the issue when merged):
- `closes`, `close`, `closed`, `closing`
- `fixes`, `fix`, `fixed`, `fixing`
- `resolves`, `resolve`, `resolved`, `resolving`
- `completes`, `complete`, `completed`, `completing`

**Contributing Magic Words** (will link without closing):
- `part of`, `contributes to`, `towards`
- `ref`, `references`, `related to`

#### Commit Message Format
Use magic words with Linear issue IDs: `<magic word> <issue-id>: <descriptive message>`

**Examples:**
- `git commit -m "fixes DEN-9: implement basic CLI game loop"`
- `git commit -m "part of DEN-10: add player input validation"`
- `git commit -m "closes DEN-11: implement game scoring system"`

**Workflow Automation:**
- Issues move to "In Progress" when branch is pushed
- Issues move to "Done" when commit is merged to default branch (master)

## Linear.app Project Management

This project uses Linear.app for tracking development progress and managing the educational backlog.

### Linear Configuration
- **Project**: Rock-Paper-Scissors (configured for educational learning progression)
- **Team**: Densom1
- **Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation Features

### Educational Labels System
- **Phase Labels**: Phase-1 (Green), Phase-2 (Blue), Phase-3 (Orange), Phase-4 (Purple), Phase-5 (Pink)
- **Complexity Labels**: beginner (Light Green), intermediate (Yellow), advanced (Red)
- **Priority Labels**: p0 (Must have), p1 (Should have), p2 (Could have), p3 (Won't have)
- **Feature Labels**: foundation, cli, ai, oop, web, multiplayer, etc.

### Issue Management
- All 14 user stories from docs/BACKLOG.md have been created as Linear issues (DEN-9 through DEN-22)
- **RPS-001: Basic CLI Game** (DEN-9) is the starting point, set to "Todo" status
- Issues follow learning progression with proper dependencies
- Story points included for educational time estimation

### Linear Usage Guidelines
- Use the linear-project-manager agent for all Linear.app configuration and issue management
- The linear-project-manager agent should ONLY handle Linear tasks, not development environment setup or code implementation
- **Issue Status Workflow**:
  - Move issues to "In Progress" when starting work
  - Move to "In Review" when implementation is complete
  - Never move to "Done".  This will be done outside of Claude
- Update issue status as development progresses through each learning phase
- Reference Linear issue numbers (e.g., DEN-9) in commit messages when implementing features
